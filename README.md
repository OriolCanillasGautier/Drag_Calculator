**Virtual Wind Tunnel Aerodynamic Drag Calculator**  
A Python application for simulating aerodynamic drag forces in a virtual wind tunnel environment with 3D visualization.  
*Not finished yet, there are some errors, if you encounter any, open an issue.*
**Features**  
- 3D visualization of wind tunnel and loaded objects  
- STL file import support for 3D models  
- Real-time drag force calculations  
- Pressure distribution visualization with color gradients  
- Interactive object manipulation (position, rotation, scaling)  
- Screenshot export capability  
- Modern GUI with theme support

**System Requirements**  
- Python 3.7+  
- Windows/Linux/macOS  
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)  
- OpenGL-capable GPU (for hardware acceleration)  

**Installation**  
1. Install Python:

You can download Python for you Operative System [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   
3. Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pyvista pyvistaqt numpy ttkthemes vtk
```  

3. (Optional) For software rendering:  
```bash
pip install pyopengl
```  

**Usage**  
1. Run the application from the terminal:  
```bash
python drag_calculator.py
```
*You can run it on windows by double-clicking on the Python file*

2. Interface controls:  
   - **File Menu**: Load STL models  
   - **Tunnel Parameters**: Set dimensions (length/width/height)  
   - **Flow Settings**: Configure air velocity/density  
   - **Object Controls**: Adjust position/rotation/scale  
   - **Simulation**: Calculate drag and visualize pressure  

3. Key interactions:  
   - Use arrow buttons to position objects  
   - Rotate objects in 15Â° increments (X/Y/Z axes)  
   - Scale objects using XYZ factors  
   - Press "Run Simulation" for drag/pressure analysis  
   - Export screenshots via "Export Image" button  

**Troubleshooting**  
- *Missing VTK DLLs (Windows)*:  
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade vtk
  ```  

- *Blank 3D window*:  
  1. Update graphics drivers  
  2. Try software rendering:  
  ```bash
  pip install pyopengl
  ```  

- *STL loading issues*:  
  - Ensure binary STL format  
  - Verify model scale (1 unit = 1 meter)
